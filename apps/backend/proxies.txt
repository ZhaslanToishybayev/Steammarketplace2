# Steam Marketplace Proxy Configuration
# =====================================
# Proxies disabled - using direct requests with rate limiting
# All requests go via local IP with SteamRateLimiter protection
#
# To enable proxies, add working proxies below in format:
# ip:port
# user:pass@ip:port
# http://user:pass@ip:port
#
# Note: Free public proxies rarely work with Steam (blocked by Akamai CDN)
# Recommended: Use residential proxies from Bright Data, Smartproxy, etc.
